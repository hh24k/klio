# Grafana Dashboards

Klio ships a Grafana dashboard template that visualizes the metrics it
exposes. The dashboard is generated from code with the
[Grafana Foundation SDK](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-foundation-sdk)
and committed to the repository at
`observability/grafana/klio-dashboard.json`.

The dashboard queries the Prometheus export of Klio's OpenTelemetry metrics,
so it complements the [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.md) setup rather than
replacing it.

## What the dashboard shows

The dashboard is a single dashboard split into row sections:

- **Client / Plugin** — the backup lifecycle as seen by the plugin sidecar
  running in each PostgreSQL pod: backups in progress, time since the last
  backup started, succeeded and failed, the latest backup duration, the
  p50/p95/p99 backup duration distribution, backup run and failure rates,
  and the backup success ratio. Also the WAL
  streaming client the sidecar supervises as a child process: the PostgreSQL
  timeline it is currently streaming and the p50/p95/p99 latency of sending
  a WAL block to the server. Finally the WAL restores the plugin serves back
  to PostgreSQL: the p95 end-to-end restore latency split by prefetch cache
  hit, and the restore rate by outcome.

- **Server** — the state of the Klio server StatefulSet: uptime, WAL ingest
  throughput and freshness per tier, the latest written LSN, backup
  verification outcomes, the base snapshot inventory (including file and
  directory counts), p50/p95/p99 WAL block/get/upload duration by path,
  stage and tier, tier-2 relay and maintenance run rates, the retention
  window of the
  physical PostgreSQL backups (counts by tier, latest/oldest backup age,
  start/end LSN and PostgreSQL timeline per cluster), and the embedded NATS
  JetStream queue.

- **WAL Replication Lag** — how far Klio's WAL streaming client trails the
  PostgreSQL primary, using CloudNativePG's replication metrics: the replay
  lag in bytes and the flush lag in seconds. These panels read the
  `cnpg_pg_stat_replication_*` metrics, so they require CloudNativePG
  monitoring to be scraped into the same Prometheus (see the prerequisites
  below).

Some panels need extra context to interpret correctly. Two are derived
from the alerting guidance in [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.md):

- **Time since last WAL written by tier** surfaces the staleness signal
  described under *Alerting on stalled WAL processing*: a stale tier-1 value
  means PostgreSQL is no longer shipping WALs, while a stale tier-2 value
  means the remote backend is no longer receiving them.
- **Tier-2 archival backlog (LSN gap)** plots the LSN difference between
  tier 1 (local disk) and tier 2 (remote storage). Read together with the
  staleness panel, it tells a slow pipeline (timestamps advancing, gap
  growing) apart from a stalled one (timestamps and LSN both frozen).

Two more are a statistical caveat rather than an alerting signal. Both are
histogram percentiles that need enough recent samples to be reliable:

- **WAL block send duration (p50/p95/p99) by cluster** is most meaningful
  under active write load. On an idle or low-write cluster, WAL blocks are
  sent too infrequently for the underlying `histogram_quantile` to produce
  a reliable percentile, so the line can look sparse or noisy rather than
  simply absent.
- **WAL restore latency (p95) by cache hit** splits on whether the segment was
  already sitting complete in the prefetch spool when PostgreSQL asked for it.
  A hit is a local rename and a miss waits on a download, so the two lines sit
  orders of magnitude apart and are deliberately not pooled: a single line
  would drift with the hit rate rather than describe either case. Because a hit
  is usually well under the histogram's smallest bucket, read that line as
  "fast" rather than as a precise value; the miss line is the one that carries
  detail. A hit rate falling over time means prefetch is no longer keeping up
  with replay.
- **Backup duration (p50/p95/p99)** has the same limitation, more acutely:
  backups are infrequent, so this panel is computed over the whole selected
  range (rather than a short rate window) to stay populated between runs.
  Widen the dashboard range to span several backups for a stable reading; if
  the selected range contains no backup, the panel is empty. Use it to spot
  backup runtime trending up over time rather than to read an instantaneous
  value.

## Prerequisites

The dashboard reads the Prometheus names of Klio's metrics (for example
`klio_plugin_backup_runs_total` and `klio_server_wal_written_total`). You
therefore need Prometheus scraping those metrics. Any of the export paths
described in [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.md) works:

- An OpenTelemetry Collector with a Prometheus exporter that Prometheus
  scrapes.
- The Klio Prometheus exporter (`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=prometheus`),
  scraped directly.

The **WAL Replication Lag** row additionally reads CloudNativePG's
`cnpg_pg_stat_replication_*` metrics. To populate it, scrape the
CloudNativePG cluster monitoring (its `PodMonitor`) into the same
Prometheus. The rest of the dashboard works without it.

:::note
When you route metrics through an OpenTelemetry Collector, enable
`resource_to_telemetry_conversion` on the Prometheus exporter so that
resource attributes such as the pod and namespace become Prometheus labels.
The sample collector under
`operator/config/samples/opentelemetry/base/otel_collector.yaml` already does
this.

## Importing the dashboard

1. In Grafana, go to **Dashboards → New → Import**.
1. Upload `observability/grafana/klio-dashboard.json` or paste its contents.
1. When prompted, select your Prometheus data source for the `datasource`
   variable.

The dashboard declares a `datasource` template variable, so it is portable
across Grafana installations and is not tied to a specific data source UID.
The `namespace` and `cluster` template variables at the top filter the panels
by Kubernetes namespace and PostgreSQL cluster.

### Example: kube-prometheus-stack

This example follows the same flow as the
[CloudNativePG quickstart](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/current/quickstart/#grafana-dashboard),
using the
[kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
chart. Adapt it to your own Prometheus/Grafana if you run a different setup —
only the metric prerequisites described above are required.

Install Prometheus and Grafana:

```sh
helm repo add prometheus-community \
  https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm upgrade --install \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/main/docs/src/samples/monitoring/kube-stack-config.yaml \
  prometheus-community prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

Ensure Prometheus scrapes Klio's metrics by deploying a `ServiceMonitor` (or a
`PodMonitor`, if the collector's `Service` has no labels) for the
OpenTelemetry collector's Prometheus exporter — see
`operator/config/samples/opentelemetry/base/otel_collector_svc_monitor.yaml`.

Port-forward Grafana and log in with `admin` / `prom-operator`:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-community-grafana 3000:80
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` and import
`observability/grafana/klio-dashboard.json` via **Dashboards → New → Import**,
selecting your Prometheus data source.

Alternatively, load it automatically through the Grafana dashboard sidecar
with a labeled `ConfigMap`:

```sh
kubectl create configmap klio-grafana-dashboard \
  --from-file=klio-dashboard.json=observability/grafana/klio-dashboard.json
kubectl label configmap klio-grafana-dashboard grafana_dashboard=1
```

## Regenerating the dashboard

The committed JSON is generated from the Go program under
`observability/grafana/`. To regenerate it after changing the generator (or
after a `grafana-foundation-sdk` bump), run from the repository root:

```sh
task grafana:gen
```

CI runs `task grafana:uncommitted`, which regenerates the dashboard and
fails if the committed JSON has drifted from the generator output. Commit
the regenerated file whenever it changes.
